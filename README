Algorithm of quick sorting (Hoare's sort) it selects an element as the anchor item, breaking the list into three: elements smaller, equal and greater than anchor.
For example [8, 1, 4, 3, 7, 9, 4] results [1, 3], [4, 4], [7] then using recursion for [1, 3], [8, 7, 9] and so on.
Add the results of the recursion in sorted_list = res_1 + res_2 + res_3
